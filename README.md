## Vercel test hosting project

I am using subdirectories to attempt to combine a static website across multiple repos and host it on Vercel this time. I am also attempting to connect the "subrepo-one" and "subrepo-two" repositories.

---

For the paths, in /subrepo-two/(.\*) the (.\*) is a placeholder for the rest of the link thats there, which is then reflected by the $1.

Well this actually worked, pretty nice.
